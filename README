Readme

This is a React native app I call sifify (i wanted swipify, but its already taken)

The app is currently in development, at principle the app will provide some of your 
spotify stats (i.e. top artist, top songs, etc) but the main niche is being able to 
go through you liked songs playlist and decide to keep or unlike songs.

usingn the popular feature that appears in tinder (swiping either left or right) 
you can decide to unlike a song or keep it in your playlist.

this provides a easy, convient and, fun way to clean up and refine your playlist 
your playlist to match fun your current listening habits.

fun fact:

i wrote this readme in a bar while drinking a guinness :)

cheers!
